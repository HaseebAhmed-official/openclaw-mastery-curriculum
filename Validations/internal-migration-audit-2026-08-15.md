# Internal Migration Audit - 2026-08-15

## Decision Record

- Candidate audited: commit `eb8d423`
- Scope: platform-agnostic Agent Harness Systems Engineering curriculum, reference harness, source controls, and OpenClaw maintenance automation
- Excluded product: Elite Mentor OS, which is separately versioned and frozen by user decision
- Reviewer: repository-authoring Codex session; this is internal evidence, not independent validation
- Review date: 2026-08-15, Asia/Karachi

## Verdict

| Claim level | Verdict | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strong self-study draft | `conditional` | The program spine, labs, assessments, sources, and bounded executable fixtures are coherent; advanced labs still need clean reproduction and some require external systems. |
| Supervised pilot | `conditional` | Run critical labs in clean learner environments first, freeze expected evidence, and brief assessors on current fixture limits. |
| Standalone ready-to-teach program | `reject` | Complete lecture delivery, accessibility review, timing evidence, and independently reproduced labs do not yet exist. |
| Institution-ready curriculum | `reject` | There is no real cohort, assessor-reliability result, delayed transfer study, independent academic review, or adoption evidence. |
| Enterprise-ready program | `reject` | There is no organizational security/privacy/legal review, production workload evidence, support model, or enterprise pilot. |
| World-class or optimum claim | `reject` | Internal artifacts and tests cannot establish comparative excellence or learning effectiveness. |

## Executed Checks

| Check | Observed result | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reference harness | 20 of 20 `unittest` cases passed | Standard-library teaching fixtures only; not a production runtime. |
| OpenClaw drift script | 4 of 4 `unittest` cases passed | Tests request construction and issue-body behavior, not GitHub Actions execution. |
| Python compilation | 15 files compiled from source | Syntax/import-independent compilation is not type, lint, or security analysis. |
| JSON parsing | 1 repository JSON file parsed | Schema semantics were reviewed manually; no separate JSON Schema exists. |
| Curriculum structure | 25 unique labs each have one guide; 90 sequential questions; 54 sequential oral prompts; both semesters contain weeks 1-16 | Structural completeness is not pedagogical validity. |
| Outcome traceability | PLO-1 through PLO-10 each map to direct evidence, teaching locations, required labs, and high-stakes assessment | Mapping is internally coherent but has not been empirically validated with learners or assessors. |
| Local Markdown links | Targets validated across 75 Markdown files | Anchor fragments and external semantics were not certified by this check. |
| Duplicate-content check | No exact duplicate curriculum files | Near-duplicate prose still requires editorial judgment. |
| Source crawl | 128 unique HTTPS URLs checked | Ten legitimate sources rejected or timed out in the generic crawler but were independently resolved through current browser/search or Crossref; two deliberate invalid fixtures and two code-span parser artifacts were excluded. |
| Secret checks | No high-confidence secret signature or likely hard-coded credential assignment found | This is a pattern scan, not full history or specialized secret scanning. |
| Git whitespace | `git diff --check` passed before candidate commit | Does not replace formatters or linters. |
| Optional analyzers | `ruff`, `mypy`, `bandit`, `gitleaks`, and `actionlint` unavailable | No result is claimed for these tools. |

## Current Source Findings

- MCP teaching now targets the `2026-07-28` stateless, per-request negotiation model instead of initialization-era assumptions.
- A2A teaching is pinned to released specification `1.0.0`.
- OpenTelemetry GenAI teaching points to the dedicated semantic-conventions repository and remains a protocol/telemetry lab requirement rather than a reference-harness claim.
- Hermes Agent evidence is pinned to `v2026.8.13`; ChatGPT Work and xAI claims are dated public-contract claims with private internals marked `unknown`.
- OpenClaw stable remains `v2026.7.1-2`, npm extended-stable remains `2026.6.34`, and beta was observed at `2026.8.1-beta.2`. Stable release drift was false at review time.
- OpenClaw advisory metadata showed 647 published records, latest publication `2026-06-30T01:11:32Z`, and latest update `2026-08-13T17:27:46Z`. The earlier review covered the 112 advisories published after the prior cutoff; this audit did not reread all 647 records.

## Findings Repaired In Candidate

1. Replaced stale MCP/A2A/OpenTelemetry assumptions with current pinned source boundaries.
2. Added dated claim ledgers for Hermes Agent, ChatGPT Work, and xAI agent tooling without inferring managed internals.
3. Added bounded memory, orchestration, integration/export, per-attempt persistence, and policy-based evaluation fixtures.
4. Rejected reused provider call identities, invalid memory-policy outputs, invalid worker outputs, malformed adapter shapes, and contaminated export event streams.
5. Clarified advisory publication versus update timestamps and recorded stable, extended-stable, and beta channels separately.
6. Pinned the GitHub checkout action and prevented drift-check authentication tokens from entering request URLs.

## Residual Blockers

- A bounded pinned MCP `2.0.0` in-process proof and A2A SDK `1.1.2` JSON-RPC/ASGI proof are now instructor-executed, but neither proves external network transport, TLS/OAuth, disconnect/timeout/retry, cancellation, side-effect approval, streaming, duplicate handling, or cross-implementation compatibility.
- A bounded OpenTelemetry SDK `1.44.0` in-memory span proof is instructor-executed against a commit-pinned development GenAI schema, but no OTLP backend, metrics/logs, SLO/alert path, production redaction audit, network model provider, or real provider compatibility fixture is reproduced.
- A bounded single-host SQLite durability fixture is now instructor-executed. It covers persisted state transitions, idempotency conflicts, bounded retries, lease recovery and fencing, cooperative cancellation, ambiguous-outcome quarantine, and manual resolution; it does not prove real process killing, enforced handler deadlines, queue/worker heartbeats, distributed state, external-service reconciliation, or exactly-once effects. Process isolation, egress control, production redaction, hostile concurrency, and hostile multi-tenant fixtures remain absent.
- Authored labs have not been independently run in clean WSL/Linux, container, VPS, and constrained-budget lanes with retained evidence.
- No representative maintained evaluation corpus, validated graders, uncertainty analysis, leakage study, or cost/latency baseline exists.
- No accessibility audit, learner timing study, measured assessor calibration, delayed unaided changed-task transfer result, or cohort pilot exists.
- No independent academic, practitioner, security, privacy/legal, or enterprise-governance review has evaluated the migrated scope.
- Ruff, MyPy with untyped-body checking, and Bandit now pass for the reference harness. Specialized secret-history and workflow-linter evidence remains absent.

## Maturity Snapshot

At the 2026-08-15 audit, planning estimates were approximately **74% artifact implementation**, **25% hands-on reproducibility evidence**, and **30% institution/enterprise proof**. They are historical prioritization aids only; the addendum below supersedes them. The completion-gate ledger in `PROJECT_STATE.md` overrides every percentage.

## Next Gate

### 2026-09-06 Authorization Fixture Addendum

This remains author-session evidence. `security.py` adds opt-in host-scoped resources and destinations with exact expiring/revocable single-use approval; the minimal foundations `Policy` retains its original reusable-grant behavior. Fourteen security methods exercise forced malicious provider calls and a deliberately vulnerable synthetic positive control, benign success, cross-resource/session denial, destination variants, changed arguments, replay, expiry/revocation, concurrent grant consumption, tool-binding drift, and denial after partial-effect failure or policy recreation. No real network request is made.

The current Windows Python 3.13.1 exact-dependency environment passed all 48 tests in 4.521 seconds. Ruff, MyPy with `--check-untyped-defs` over 19 source/test files, Bandit on `src`, four drift-script tests, and `git diff --check` passed. Three existing upstream A2A protobuf deprecation warnings remain. A type error in the deliberate schema-mutation test was repaired with an explicit type narrowing. This is worktree execution; fresh archive/WSL evidence will be recorded separately.

LAB-C6's existing guide now includes runnable commands, trust assumptions, exploit/control/end-state predictions, benign controls, detection/recovery evidence, required unseen variants, and oral-defense criteria. The fixture has trusted host identities/handlers and no real model, network/OS enforcement, persistent approvals, malicious-handler containment, or independent audit. Its single-grant lock is not full runtime concurrency safety. LAB-C6 remains `authored`, and the readiness verdicts above remain unchanged. Only two new files were needed; all teaching/state/source changes reuse canonical files.

### Continuing Gate

Final commit-bound evaluator evidence, 2026-09-06: a fresh archive of `1423d88` passed all 50 tests in 12.421 seconds in WSL Python 3.13.9 using the committed lock and offline cached dependencies. Directory: `/tmp/harness-1423d88.7iofeT`. Command: `uv run --offline --python 3.13 --extra interop --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`. Three known A2A protobuf warnings remained. The LAB-C7 starting fixture is internally `executed`; the complete lab remains `authored`. This does not supply independent reviewer or learner evidence.

2026-09-06 follow-up: security implementation `b2a0221` passed all 48 tests from a clean Git archive in fresh WSL at `/tmp/harness-b2a0221.tyzzwz`, Python 3.13.9, Linux 6.18.33.2 x86-64, using `uv run --python 3.13 --extra interop --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`. Test time was 6.949 seconds excluding environment setup. Three known upstream A2A warnings remained. This is instructor execution, not independent reproduction.

A separate evaluator defect was reproduced: with zero pass-rate thresholds, a factory exception could approve a release. The repair records infrastructure failures explicitly and vetoes approval regardless of scoring thresholds. Ordinary negative grades remain task outcomes; available runs survive grader failure. Five evaluator methods now include factory exceptions, grader exceptions, malformed grade, critical-task veto, and valid negative-grade behavior. All 50 worktree tests passed in the Windows exact-dependency environment in 2.952 seconds; Ruff, MyPy with untyped-body checking, Bandit on source, and Git whitespace checks passed. LAB-C7's new exercise explains the measurement boundary and requires a maintained corpus and calibrated graders before stronger evaluation claims. No readiness percentage or verdict is raised by this repair.

Reproduce the critical lab path in a clean learner environment and retain commands, inputs, outputs, failures, environment fingerprints, timing, and assessor decisions. Do not promote readiness claims until that evidence is reviewed and the residual blockers are materially reduced.

## 2026-08-16 Interoperability Addendum

This addendum is still author-session evidence, not independent review. The reference harness gained one optional exact-version lane: MCP Python SDK `2.0.0`, A2A Python SDK `1.1.2`, and OpenTelemetry SDK `1.44.0`. The default standard-library lane remains dependency-free.

The full 24-test suite passed on Windows Python 3.11.9 and from a Git archive of implementation commit `25d06ae` extracted into a fresh WSL `/tmp` directory. The commit-bound run used CPython 3.14.2, Linux 6.18.33.2 x86-64, glibc 2.35, and an offline Linux wheelhouse; tests took 3.182 seconds. It observed MCP `2026-07-28` discovery and schema rejection, an authenticated A2A JSON-RPC task/artifact exchange plus `401` denial, and linked in-memory agent/tool spans that omitted supplied sensitive values. A2A emitted three upstream protobuf `label()` deprecation warnings.

The fixture is `executed`; LAB-C4, LAB-C5, and LAB-C8 remain `authored`. No second person reproduced the work. Updated planning estimates are approximately **76% artifact implementation**, **28% hands-on reproducibility evidence**, and **30% institution/enterprise proof**. The strong readiness verdicts remain rejected.

## 2026-08-16 Durable Execution Addendum

This addendum is also author-session evidence, not independent review. Implementation commit `a78f42a` added a standard-library SQLite durable-work starting fixture with an explicit state/version contract, atomic claims, per-claim lease-token fencing, bounded retry policy, idempotency-intent checks, cancellation, expired-lease recovery, quarantine, compensation/manual resolution, and an append-only application transition ledger.

The exact-dependency 34-test suite passed on Windows. A Git archive of implementation head `ac25d63` then passed all 34 tests after fresh extraction under WSL using CPython 3.14.2, Linux 6.18.33.2 x86-64, glibc 2.35, and the offline exact-version wheelhouse; the test runner reported 3.150 seconds and the measured command elapsed time was 3.843 seconds. Ruff, exact-environment MyPy with `--check-untyped-defs`, Bandit, `uv lock --check`, compilation, drift tests, local-link checks, and Git whitespace checks also passed. The three A2A protobuf `label()` deprecation warnings remain upstream warnings in the optional integration lane.

The durability fixture is `executed`; LAB-C2 remains `authored`. There was no independent learner, real process kill, enforced call timeout, distributed worker system, or external side-effect service. Updated planning estimates are approximately **78% artifact implementation**, **30% hands-on reproducibility evidence**, and **30% institution/enterprise proof**. The strong readiness verdicts remain rejected.
